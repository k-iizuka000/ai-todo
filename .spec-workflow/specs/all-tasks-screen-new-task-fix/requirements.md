# Requirements Document

## Introduction

[全てのタスク]画面における「新しいタスク」作成機能で、プロジェクトとタグの設定が正常に動作しない問題を修正します。現在、プロジェクトを選択してもボタンに反映されず、タグセレクターをクリックしてもドロップダウンが表示されない状況により、ユーザーは適切にタスクを分類・整理することができません。この問題は、タスク管理の効率性と整理機能に直接影響を与える重要な機能障害です。

## Alignment with Product Vision

このバグ修正は、ユーザーが効率的にタスクを管理・整理できるという製品ビジョンの中核をなします。プロジェクトとタグによるタスクの分類機能は、TODO管理アプリケーションにおける組織化の基盤であり、この機能が正常に動作することでユーザー体験の大幅な向上が期待されます。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select a project from the project selector dropdown in the new task creation form, so that I can properly categorize my task under the correct project and see the selected project reflected in the form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks on the project selector button THEN system SHALL display a dropdown with available projects
2. WHEN user selects a project from the dropdown THEN system SHALL update the project selector button to show the selected project name and close the dropdown
3. WHEN user submits the form with a selected project THEN system SHALL create the task associated with the selected project
4. WHEN project selection is successful THEN system SHALL maintain the selected project state throughout the form interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select or create tags from the tag selector combobox in the new task creation form, so that I can properly label and organize my tasks with relevant tags.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks on the tag selector combobox THEN system SHALL display a dropdown with available tags and an input field for creating new tags
2. WHEN user selects an existing tag from the dropdown THEN system SHALL add the tag to the selected tags list and keep the dropdown open for additional selections
3. WHEN user types in the combobox input THEN system SHALL filter available tags in real-time and show matching options
4. WHEN user creates a new tag by typing and pressing Enter THEN system SHALL create the new tag and add it to the selected tags list
5. WHEN user removes a selected tag THEN system SHALL remove the tag from the selected tags list without affecting other selections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual feedback when interacting with project and tag selectors, so that I understand the current state of my selections and can confidently proceed with task creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project selector is opened THEN system SHALL show visual indication (expanded state) and proper focus management
2. WHEN tags are selected THEN system SHALL display selected tags as badges or chips below the combobox
3. WHEN form validation occurs THEN system SHALL show specific error messages for missing project or tag requirements if applicable
4. WHEN selections are made THEN system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback confirming the user's choices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and state management for the project and tag selector components, so that users receive helpful feedback when issues occur and the form maintains consistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project or tag data fails to load THEN system SHALL display appropriate error messages and provide retry mechanisms
2. WHEN network issues occur during project/tag selection THEN system SHALL gracefully handle the error and preserve user input
3. WHEN component state becomes inconsistent THEN system SHALL reset to a known good state without losing other form data
4. WHEN API calls fail during tag creation THEN system SHALL show specific error messages and allow user to retry

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Project selector and tag selector components should be separate, reusable components with clear interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Form state management, component rendering, and API integration should be cleanly separated
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between selector components and parent form component
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit contracts between selector components and their data sources

### Performance
- Project and tag dropdown should render within 200ms of user interaction
- Tag filtering should provide real-time feedback with < 100ms response time
- Form submission with selected projects and tags should complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- Component re-rendering should be optimized to avoid unnecessary updates

### Security
- Input validation must be performed for both project selection and tag creation
- Tag names must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Project IDs must be validated to ensure they exist and user has access
- Selected data must be validated on both client-side and server-side

### Reliability
- Project and tag selection must work consistently across different browsers and devices
- Component state must be preserved during form interactions and network interruptions
- Error recovery should allow users to retry failed operations without losing form data
- Integration with existing task creation flow must not introduce regressions

### Usability
- Error messages must be clear, actionable, and displayed in user's preferred language (Japanese)
- Project and tag selectors should provide intuitive keyboard navigation support
- Visual indicators should clearly communicate selection state and available actions
- Form should provide auto-save or draft functionality to prevent data loss during longer interactions
