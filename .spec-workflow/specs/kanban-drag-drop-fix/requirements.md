# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the kanban board drag-and-drop functionality where tasks fail to move between columns despite UI interaction being recognized. The fix will restore the core task management workflow that enables users to track project progress effectively.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This bugfix directly supports the AI-Todo application's core mission of providing intuitive task management through visual kanban boards. Restoring reliable drag-and-drop functionality is essential for user productivity and trust in the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Column-to-Column Task Movement

**User Story:** As a user managing tasks on a kanban board, I want to drag and drop tasks between columns (To Do → In Progress → Done), so that I can easily update task status and visualize project progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a task from "To Do" column and drops it on "In Progress" column THEN the system SHALL update the task status from "To Do" to "In Progress"
2. WHEN a task is successfully moved between columns THEN the system SHALL visually move the task from the source column to the target column within 1 second
3. WHEN a task is moved between columns THEN the system SHALL update the task count display for both source and target columns
4. WHEN a user drags a task from any column to any other valid column THEN the system SHALL update the task status accordingly

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the kanban board, I want reliable feedback when drag-and-drop operations fail, so that I understand the system state and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a drag-and-drop operation fails due to network error THEN the system SHALL revert the UI changes and display an error message with retry option
2. WHEN a user drops a task outside valid drop zones THEN the system SHALL return the task to its original position
3. WHEN a user drops a task in the same column THEN the system SHALL not perform any status update or API call
4. WHEN multiple simultaneous drag operations occur THEN the system SHALL process them sequentially without data corruption

### Requirement 3: Same-Column Drop Prevention

**User Story:** As a user dragging tasks within the same column, I want the system to ignore meaningless operations, so that unnecessary processing and API calls are avoided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drops a task within the same column THEN the system SHALL not change the task status
2. WHEN a same-column drop occurs THEN the system SHALL not make any backend API calls
3. WHEN the dragged task ID matches the drop zone ID THEN the system SHALL treat it as a no-op

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate drag-and-drop handling, status update logic, and UI state management
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable drag-drop components that can be extended to other parts of the application
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between drag-drop logic and specific task data structures
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear contracts between drag-drop handlers, state management, and backend API calls

### Performance
- Task status updates must complete within 1 second of drop operation
- UI state changes must be reflected immediately (optimistic updates)
- Failed operations must revert UI state within 500ms

### Security
- Validate all task status transitions on the backend
- Prevent unauthorized task modifications through proper authentication checks
- Sanitize task IDs and column identifiers to prevent injection attacks

### Reliability
- Implement retry logic for failed network requests
- Ensure data consistency between frontend state and backend data
- Handle race conditions when multiple users modify the same task

### Usability
- Provide clear visual feedback during drag operations (drag preview, hover states)
- Display appropriate loading states during status updates
- Show meaningful error messages when operations fail
