# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for fixing the drag-and-drop functionality in the Kanban task management system. Currently, tasks cannot be properly moved between columns using drag-and-drop operations, which significantly impacts the user experience and workflow efficiency.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This bug fix directly supports the core product functionality of providing an intuitive, efficient task management interface. The drag-and-drop capability is essential for quick task status updates and maintaining a smooth user workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enable Cross-Column Task Movement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag tasks from one status column to another, so that I can quickly update task progress without manual editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a task from "To Do" column THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the task is being dragged
2. WHEN a user drops a task on "In Progress" column THEN the system SHALL move the task to that column
3. WHEN a task is successfully moved THEN the system SHALL update the task's status in the backend
4. IF the drop operation fails THEN the system SHALL return the task to its original position
5. WHEN a task is moved between columns THEN the system SHALL persist the change immediately

### Requirement 2: Proper Drag Event Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want drag-and-drop operations to be reliably detected and processed, so that my actions always result in the expected outcome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragstart event occurs THEN the system SHALL capture the task ID and source column
2. WHEN dragover event occurs on a valid drop zone THEN the system SHALL allow the drop operation
3. WHEN drop event occurs THEN the system SHALL process the task movement logic
4. IF drop occurs on the same column THEN the system SHALL not perform any status update
5. WHEN drag operation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL reset the UI state properly

### Requirement 3: Visual Feedback During Drag Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations, so that I understand what actions are possible and their results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging starts THEN the system SHALL apply visual styling to the dragged element
2. WHEN hovering over a valid drop zone THEN the system SHALL highlight the target column
3. WHEN hovering over an invalid drop zone THEN the system SHALL indicate the area is not droppable
4. WHEN drop is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success indication
5. IF drop fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Drag-and-drop logic should be isolated in dedicated modules
- **Modular Design**: Event handlers, state management, and UI updates should be separated
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between drag-drop functionality and other features
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between drag-drop components and task management system

### Performance
- Drag operations must be responsive with no perceptible lag (< 100ms response time)
- State updates should complete within 200ms of drop action
- No memory leaks from event listener management

### Security
- Validate all task movements on the backend before persisting
- Ensure users can only move tasks they have permission to modify
- Prevent XSS attacks through proper event data sanitization

### Reliability
- All drag-and-drop operations must work consistently across supported browsers
- System must handle network failures gracefully during status updates
- Implement proper error recovery mechanisms for failed operations

### Usability
- Drag-and-drop must work on both desktop and touch devices
- Visual feedback must be clear and intuitive
- Operations must be reversible (undo capability)
