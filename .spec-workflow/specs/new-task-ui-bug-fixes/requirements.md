# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI bugs in the new task creation functionality that prevent users from completing task creation workflows successfully. These bugs were identified through detailed browser-based testing and significantly impact user experience and system usability.

The primary issues are:
1. Modal closure when selecting projects during task creation
2. Duplicate tag display causing visual confusion

## Alignment with Product Vision

These bug fixes align with our product vision by:
- Ensuring core task creation functionality works reliably
- Maintaining user trust through stable UI interactions
- Supporting user productivity by removing workflow interruptions
- Preserving data integrity by preventing incomplete task submissions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Selection Modal Stability

**User Story:** As a user creating a new task, I want to select a project without the modal unexpectedly closing, so that I can complete my task creation workflow successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on the project combobox THEN the task creation modal SHALL remain open
2. WHEN I select a project from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL update the project field AND keep the modal open
3. WHEN I click outside the modal (but not on form elements) THEN the system SHALL close the modal
4. IF I have entered task information before project selection THEN the system SHALL preserve all entered data during project selection
5. WHEN the project selection interaction is complete THEN the system SHALL allow me to continue with other form fields

### Requirement 2: Tag Display Consistency

**User Story:** As a user adding tags to my task, I want tags to display in only one location to avoid visual confusion, so that I can understand which tags are actually applied to my task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new tag THEN the system SHALL display the tag in exactly one location
2. IF I have selected tags THEN the system SHALL show them either in the dedicated tag area OR inline with the input field, but not both
3. WHEN I remove a tag THEN the system SHALL remove it from the single display location
4. WHEN I view my selected tags THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication of which tags are active
5. WHEN the modal reopens with existing task data THEN the system SHALL display tags consistently with the creation flow

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Event handlers should have clear, single purposes (modal control vs form updates)
- **Modular Design**: Modal behavior, form state, and UI components should be clearly separated
- **Dependency Management**: Event propagation should be controlled and predictable
- **Clear Interfaces**: Form components should have well-defined props and callbacks

### Performance
- Modal interactions should respond within 100ms to maintain perceived responsiveness
- Event handlers should not cause unnecessary re-renders
- Form state updates should be batched to avoid UI flickering

### Security
- Form data should be validated before submission even if modal closes unexpectedly
- No sensitive data should be exposed in event handling debugging

### Reliability
- Event handling should be resilient to rapid user interactions
- Modal state should recover gracefully from unexpected closures
- Form state should persist correctly across component re-renders

### Usability
- Project selection should follow standard dropdown interaction patterns
- Tag display should be immediately comprehensible to users
- Error states should provide clear feedback about incomplete submissions
- Modal behavior should be consistent with other modals in the application
